					<h1>About</h1>
					<h2>WHY THIS WEBSITE?</h2>
					<p>This website is about astronomy and the other resources science and spaceprospection</p>
					<p> Space prospection has reached to a new level of astronomy and space </p>
					<P>This website will help to know people ab out the missions of Space prosp;ection and other space organization like
						NASA and about their mission</P>



					<h2> ABOUT missions and spacecraft </h2>
					<p> space prospection uis new space and astromy organization of the world</p>
					<p> Recently it has reached a new level of success</p>
					<p> We reveal the missions of our own organization and other organiizations missions for nmankind</p>
					<p>Everybody have rights to know about Everything</p>
					<p>So we are doingg our best for that</p>

						More than 100 Soviet and Russian Soyuz manned spacecraft (TMA version shown) have flown since 1967 and now support the International
						Space Station. Columbia's first launch on the mission The US Space Shuttle flew 135 times from 1981 to 2011, supporting
						Spacelab, Mir, and the ISS. (Columbia's first launch, which had a white external tank, shown) A spacecraft is a vehicle
						or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications,
						earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans
						and cargo. All spacecraft except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch
						vehicle (carrier rocket). On a sub-orbital spaceflight, a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface,
						without having gone into an orbit. For orbital spaceflights, spacecraft enter closed orbits around the Earth or around
						other celestial bodies. Spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start
						or on orbit (space stations) only, whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically.
						Robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around
						a planetary body are artificial satellites. Only a handful of interstellar probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager
						1 and 2, and New Horizons, are on trajectories that leave the Solar System. Orbital spacecraft may be recoverable or
						not. By method of reentry to Earth they may be divided in non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes. Humanity
						has achieved space flight but only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches: Russia (RSA or "Roscosmos"),
						the United States (NASA), the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan (JAXA), China (CNSA), India (ISRO),
						Taiwan[1][2][3][4] (National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Taiwan National Space Organization (NSPO),[5][6][7]
						Israel (ISA), Iran (ISA), and North Korea (NADA).</p>
