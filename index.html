									<h2>FINDING PLANET X-123</h2>
									<span>FEBRUARY 6, 2023</span>
									<p>January 12, 2018 - 06:25
Technological advances have allowed scientists to find thousands of exoplanets during the past few decades. But even better methods are on the way, and perhaps we will find life on other planets within the next 20 years.

Proxima Centauri b is a bit smaller than Earth and orbits a red dwarf star, Proxima Centauri, which itself orbits a double star, Alpha Centauri. Any inhabitants on the planet will therefore see three suns in the sky.
The idea of life on other planets is old and can be traced back to ancient times, but until just a few years ago this was all it was—an idea.</P>

									<h1>NEW SATELLITE DISH</h1>
									<p>The parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish’s focal point. Mounted on brackets at the dish's focal point is a device called a feedhorn. This feedhorn is essentially the front-end of a waveguide that gathers the signals at or near the focal point and 'conducts' them to a low-noise block downconverter or LNB. The LNB converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked C-band and/or Ku-band to the L-band range. Direct broadcast satellite dishes use an LNBF, which integrates the feedhorn with the LNB. (A new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna, which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the University of Waterloo in 2004.[1] </p>

									<h1>FLOOD DETECTOR</h1>
									<span>FEBRUARY 3, 2023</span>
									<p>In January 2015, the Shire River in Malawi, and Zambezi River in Mozambique were under tight scrutiny. Weeks of torrential rains led these and other rivers to burst their banks displacing 390,000 people across the region. In southern Malawi 220,000 acres of farmland were turned into a lake, cutting off roads and stranding thousands of people on patches of high ground. The flood was devastating for the country, but within 72 hours of it being declared an emergency the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) was on the ground distributing food to residents.

											The quick response was supported by early warnings from the WFP's Emergency Preparedness & Support Division in Rome where meteorologist Emily Niebuhr and her colleagues had been monitoring Malawi's weather and the flood waters. And they were doing that with tools that were developed with data from NASA satellites</p>
